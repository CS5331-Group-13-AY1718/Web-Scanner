# Web Vulnerability Scanner

As part of the CS5331 coursework, we will implement a Web Scanner to:
- Crawl for available web endpoints and URLs.
- Determine if the endpoint is vulnerable.
- Generate an exploit if the endpoint is vulnerable.

## Vulnerability Categories
Our scanner will detect and attempt to exploit the following categories:
- SQL Injection
- Server Side Code Injection
- Directory Traversal
- Open Redirect
- Cross Site Request Forgery
- Shell Command Injection
